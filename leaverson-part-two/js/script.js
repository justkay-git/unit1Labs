Step 1: prompt user for pet name
    - store user input in variable (petName)
Step 2: Set Pet energy and happiness levels to zero
    - create variables (energylvl), (happylvl)
Step 3: declare feed, pet, walk, options
    ~ feed = 2+ energy increase
    ~ pet = 1+ happiness increase
    ~ walk = 2+ happiness increase & 1- energy
        - if user chooses walk & energy lvl = 0, do NOT perform actions.
       instead, prompt alert message: "Not enough energy to enjoy a walk."
Step 4: create loop that repeats 6 times the following
    - prompt user for an action input
